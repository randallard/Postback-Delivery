Server Installs

FUNCTIONALITY
requests can be made to /i or /ingest.php
data is pushed to redis list 'postbackQueue'
set-up pm2 for daemonization (see pm2-setup.txt)

TO DO:
Probably not as easy as 'key' 'value' - maybe need to update ingest to get params/labels from endpoint
Look into LUA - use predis readme?
Make sure redis, nginx, and node app start autmatically on server start
Check other redis.conf values in /etc for optimization


here is a list of changes/files/urls applied to the server - most recent changes are at the top of the list



implement redis push in ingest.php
	- test with [redis-cli lrange postbackQueue 0 -1]

set up redis.conf in etc
	- set to daemonize for automatic startup
	- check other config values to optimize at a later date

in cgi-bin clone predis [git clone git://github.com/nrk/predis.git]

install tcl for redis make test [apt-get install tcl-tls]
install redis [http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz]

in /usr/share/nginx/html/i ln -s ../ingest.php index.html
created /usr/share/nginx/html/i for symbolic link to ingest.php
created /usr/share/nginx/html/ingest.php to receive data
created /usr/share/nginx/html/index.php to send data

in /etc/php5/fpm/php.ini
cgi.fix_pathinfo=0

install nginx and php5
