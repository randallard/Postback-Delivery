# Postback-Delivery
Postback Delivery System using PHP, Node.js, and Redis

I set this up to play with as postback-agent.com and somehow nixed the IP access... well it's unreliable at this point.  So the best way to post is to set 

45.55.35.202 postback-agent.com

in the host file of the machine where your browser is running

Implementation notes (not polished) are in implementation.txt
setup notes are in notes/server-setup.txt and notes/pm2-setup.txt
